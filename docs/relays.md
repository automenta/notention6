# Connecting to Your Own Nostr Relay in Notention

Notention allows you to connect to any Nostr relay, including your own personal or private relay. Using your own relay
can offer several benefits:

- **Enhanced Privacy:** You have more control over who sees your data (even if encrypted, metadata can be sensitive).
- **Data Ownership & Persistence:** You manage the storage and uptime of your notes and ontology backups. Public relays
  may not store data indefinitely or could go offline.
- **Performance:** A local or nearby private relay can sometimes offer faster access.
- **Reduced Censorship Risk:** Your data is less likely to be censored or blocked if you control the relay.

## Why Run Your Own Relay?

While Notention works perfectly with public relays for discovery and interaction, using a personal relay for your
primary data backup and sync provides the strongest guarantee of data sovereignty. You can still connect to public
relays for broader network interactions while using your private relay as your "home base."

## Setting Up Your Own Relay

Setting up a Nostr relay involves running relay software on a server you control. This could be a home server, a Virtual
Private Server (VPS), or a cloud instance.

Popular Nostr relay software includes:

- **nostream:** A popular, robust relay written in TypeScript. (Find it on
  GitHub: [https://github.com/Cameri/nostream](https://github.com/Cameri/nostream))
- **strfry:** A high-performance relay written in C. (Find it on
  GitHub: [https://github.com/hoytech/strfry](https://github.com/hoytech/strfry))
- **Nostr RS Relay:** A relay implementation in Rust. (Find it on
  GitHub: [https://github.com/thesimplekid/nostr-rs-relay](https://github.com/thesimplekid/nostr-rs-relay))

Follow the documentation provided by your chosen relay software to install and configure it. Key considerations:

- **Domain Name & SSL:** For `wss://` (secure WebSocket) connections, which are standard, you'll need a domain name and
  an SSL certificate (Let's Encrypt is a free option).
- **Data Persistence:** Configure how your relay stores data (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL, LMDB).
- **Resource Requirements:** Relay resource needs depend on usage. A personal relay usually has modest requirements.

## Adding Your Relay in Notention

Once your relay is running and accessible via a WebSocket URL (e.g., `wss://your-relay-domain.com`), you can add it to
Notention:

1. **Open Notention.**
2. **Go to Settings:** Look for a settings panel or user profile section where Nostr relays are managed.
3. **Add Relay URL:**
   - You should find a list of currently connected relays.
   - There will be an option to "Add Relay" or a similar input field.
   - Enter the full WebSocket URL of your relay (e.g., `wss://my.personal.relay.example.com`).
4. **Save Changes:** Ensure your changes to the relay list are saved.
5. **Reconnect/Resubscribe (Automatic or Manual):** Notention should attempt to connect to the new relay. You might want
   to toggle your network connection within the app or restart it if you don't see immediate connection success (though
   this shouldn't typically be necessary).

**Tips for Using Your Own Relay:**

- **Primary Relay:** You might make your personal relay the first one in the list or the only one for certain types of
  data if the app offers such granularity (Notention's current sync uses all configured relays).
- **Backup:** Even with your own relay, ensure you have backups of your relay's data directory itself, as hardware can
  fail.
- **Public Relays for Discovery:** You can keep public relays in your list to discover notes and users from the wider
  Nostr network, while your personal notes sync primarily through your own relay.

By taking control of your relay, you fully embrace the decentralized ethos of Nostr and Notention!
