# Notention

A lightweight, client-side Progressive Web App (PWA) for decentralized note-taking and network matching. It enables users to capture, organize, and share notes with embedded semantic structure (tags, values, fields, templates) within freeform text, using a user-editable, shareable ontology to drive structured organization and semantic matching. The Nostr protocol powers secure, peer-to-peer collaboration, allowing users to publish notes and discover related content across a decentralized network. Core functionality requires no language model, ensuring accessibility, while an optional local language model enhances ontology suggestions, auto-tagging, and summarization. Netention prioritizes privacy with local-first storage, end-to-end encryption, and minimal dependencies, targeting universal adoption on web and mobile devices.

## Features

## Getting Started

1. **Installation**:
   - As a Progressive Web App (PWA), Notention can be installed directly from your browser on both desktop and mobile devices. Look for the "Install" button in the address bar or browser menu.
   - Once installed, it works offline, caching your notes and syncing with the network when you're online.

2. **Account Setup**:
   - On first launch, you'll be guided through an account creation wizard.
   - Notention uses a Nostr keypair for identity. You can either generate a new one or import an existing private key.
   - **Important**: Back up your private key securely. It is the only way to recover your account.

### Instant Messaging

- Using secure Nostr Direct Messages (DM)
- Buddy list
- Discussions
- User Profiles
- Account creation wizard

### Note-Taking with Semantic Structure

- **Rich Text Editor**:
  - Powered by Tiptap for extensible editing.
  - Supports bold, italic, bulleted/numbered lists, and hyperlinks.
  - Markdown-like syntax (e.g., `*text*` for italic).
  - Semantic elements:
    - **Tags**: Inline `#Topic` or `@Person`, linked to ontology, inserted via autocomplete or toolbar.
    - **Values**: Key-value pairs (e.g., `due::2025-06-01`) for metadata, added inline or via sidebar.
    - **Fields**: Template-defined fields (e.g., `Status: In Progress`), editable in sidebar.
    - **Templates**: Predefined note structures (e.g., “Meeting Note” with `Date`, `Attendees`), applied via dropdown.
  - Insertion interface:
    - Autocomplete on `#` or `@` with ontology-based suggestions.
    - Toolbar for inserting tags, values, fields, or templates.
    - Sidebar form for metadata editing with real-time editor preview.
- **Active Notes**:
  - Notes include metadata: UUID `id`, `title`, `content`, `tags`, `values`, `fields`, `status` (draft/published), `createdAt`, `updatedAt`.
  - Operations: create, edit, delete, archive, pin.
  - Search: full-text with filters for tags, values, fields, using ontology relationships (e.g., `#NLP` finds `#AI` notes).
- **Organization**:
  - Hierarchical folders for grouping notes.
  - Ontology-linked tags for categorization.
  - List view, sortable by title, date, or tags.
- **Persistence**:
  - Stored locally in IndexedDB via localforage.
  - Export/import notes as JSON for backups or migration.

### Ontology System

- **Definition**:
  - User-editable taxonomy of concepts and relationships (e.g., `#AI > #MachineLearning > #NLP`), stored as a JSON tree.
  - Concepts have `label` (e.g., `#Project`) and optional `attributes` (e.g., `due::date`).
  - Relationships include parent-child links (e.g., `#NLP` under `#AI`).
  - Loose, tolerating fuzzy/partial matching and vague/missing data
- **Interface**:
  - Drag-and-drop tree editor for concepts and hierarchies.
  - Form for defining concept attributes (e.g., `type: date`).
  - Accessible via “Ontology” sidebar tab.
- **Role**:
  - Links tags, values, fields to concepts for semantic consistency.
  - Enables semantic search (e.g., `#NLP` matches `#AI` notes).
  - Drives network matching via relationship traversal (e.g., `#NLP` matches `#AI` on Nostr).
- **Persistence and Sharing**:
  - Stored in IndexedDB.
  - Shareable via Nostr as public or private events; importable by other users.

### Network Matching

- **Nostr Integration**:
  - Publish notes as public Nostr events or encrypted private shares (NIP-04).
  - User identity via locally stored Nostr keypair, generated during onboarding.
  - Topic-based channels (e.g., `#Notes`) for sharing and discovery.
  - Accessible via “Network” sidebar tab.
- **Ontology-Based Matching**:
  - Matches notes by shared tags/values and ontology relationships.
  - Example: `#NLP` note matches public `#AI` or `#MachineLearning` notes.
  - Uses client-side graph traversal for matching.
  - Matches shown in “Matches” panel with links to view notes or contact authors.
- **Privacy Controls**:
  - Notes are private by default.
  - Users can set note status to "draft", "private", or "published".
  - UI indicators (e.g., “Published” status on shared notes).
- **Public Feed**:
  - A public feed of notes from the Nostr network is displayed in the "Network" panel.
- **Notifications**:
  - Real-time alerts for matches or channel activity in a notification bar.

### AI Enhancements (Optional)

Notention can leverage local or cloud-based AI models to provide intelligent features. This is entirely optional and the application is fully functional without it.

- **Integration**: Uses LangChain.js to connect with AI providers like a local Ollama instance or Google Gemini.
- **Enabling AI**:
  - Navigate to `Settings > AI Features`.
  - Toggle "Enable AI" on.
- **Configuration**:
  - **Ollama**:
    - Install Ollama on your local machine by following the instructions at [https://ollama.com](https://ollama.com).
    - Once Ollama is running (e.g., `ollama serve`), ensure you have pulled a model (e.g., `ollama pull llama3`).
    - In Notention's AI settings, enter your Ollama API endpoint (e.g., `http://localhost:11434`).
  - **Google Gemini**:
    - Obtain an API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
    - In Notention's AI settings, enter your Gemini API Key.
  - _Note_: You can configure one or both. The application may prioritize Gemini if both are available, unless otherwise specified.
- **Features**:
  - **Ontology Suggestions**: In the Ontology Editor, use the "AI Suggest" button to get ideas for new concepts or relationships based on your existing ontology and optional context you provide.
  - **Auto-tagging**: While editing a note, use the "Auto-tag" button in the toolbar to let AI suggest relevant tags based on the note's content and your ontology.
  - **Summarization**: Use the "Summarize" button in the Note Editor toolbar to generate a concise summary of the current note. The summary can be reviewed and optionally inserted into the note.
  - **Embedding Vectors (Future)**: Future updates will explore using embedding vectors for enhanced semantic search and network matching.
- **Fallback**: If AI is not enabled or configured, these features will be unavailable, but the application remains fully functional for manual note-taking and organization.
- **Sharing AI Results**: Users with AI support can share usable results (e.g., AI-assisted tags on a published note) with other users, even those not using AI features.

### Client-Side PWA

- **Offline-First**:
  - Service Workers cache assets for offline use.
  - Notes and ontology saved locally, synced to Nostr when online.
- **User Interface**:
  - Layout: single-column (mobile), two-column (desktop, editor + sidebar).
  - Components:
    - Tiptap-based note editor with toolbar and autocomplete.
    - Sidebar tabs: Notes (list, search), Ontology (tree editor), Network (matches, channels), Settings.
    - Notification bar for alerts.
  - Styling: custom CSS with light/dark themes.
- **Installation**:
  - Installable as PWA via browser prompts on web and mobile.
- **Syncing**:
